# FrontEnd

This is a solution to the basic HTML page with images, links and forms

## Overview

## My process
### Built with
Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties

### What I learned
HTML is responsible for web structure
- Element names are surrounded by angle brackets
- Tag elements usually come in pairs (Start and end tag)
-  Some tags close themselves

Examples:
- <h1> Example </h1>
- <br/> (Self closing tag)
- <br> (is fine with HTML5)

Total 6 heading tags (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)

Level Elements:
  Inline VS Block:
    - Block elements are start on a new line and take the full width available
    - Inline elements do not start on a new line and take only the necessary width
Some examples on block and inline level elements
 - Block Level: <div>, <h1> till <h6>, <p>,
 - Inline levelL <span>. <a>, <button>

<div> is hold to elements together
