# FrontEnd

This is a solution to the basic HTML page with images, links and forms

## Overview

## My process
### Built with
Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties

### What I learned
HTML is responsible for web structure
- Element names are surrounded by angle brackets
- Tag elements usually come in pairs (Start and end tag)
-  Some tags close themselves
- Total 6 heading tags (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)

#### Level Elements:
  Inline VS Block:
    - Block elements are start on a new line and take the full width available
    - Inline elements do not start on a new line and take only the necessary width

### cLists
Ordered lists and unordered lists
